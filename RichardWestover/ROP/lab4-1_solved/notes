I wrote a program to generate MD5 hashes. Give it a try! Send it some data, and it will send back the MD5 hash of your data. Just don't enter too much data; for some reason that seems to crash it.... weird. Anyway, it has that fancy "NX" feature enabled, so it should be safe... right? :)

There are a million and one resources online, but here's a currated list of the ones I think are well written and most relevant. If you're unsure where to start, maybe give these a read.

If you're familiar with the YouTuber "LiveOverflow", he has some nice videos on the subject as well.

To see if ASLR is enabled: checksec <filename>

Ideas to bypass ASLR
- Leak and calculate
	pointer = baseaddress + offset
	Therefor baseaddress = pointer - offset
	Offsets can then be calculated if we know the baseaddress
- Partial overwrite
	Overwrite only the last byte/bytes in return address to call a function close in disassembly to where it is supposed to return to
- Memory spray
	Generate a NOP sled/RET sled and have that crash into your shellcode. The teacher had it on +rx memoryspace but wasn't really on stack. But not on Heap either

# [TODO checkout vmmap in gdb
# vmmap in gdb to find base address... or something...

# checksec to see permissions

# p.readuntil()

# <objdump -d -Mintel my.bin> to see the goods

# echo -en "somestuff\x69" | ./my.bin to send it bytes, without the newline character

# pgrep so you don't have to find PID, e.g. gdb $(pgrep file.bin)

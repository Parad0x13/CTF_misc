Had to disable PIE/NX/ASlR with:
gcc lab6-1.c -o  lab6-1.bin -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -z execstack

checksec return:
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    No canary found
NX:       NX disabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
RWX:      Has RWX segments

We noticed that it may be possible to send a ROP chain against configure_username (case selection 1)
Knowing this we can hopefully get the pid of the process via getpid() which is statically compiled at location 0x401060 [0000000000401060 <getpid@plt>]

This ended up not being the case as the lines:
scanf("%15s", tmp);
strncpy(auth_username, tmp, 16);
Ensure in both situations that we cannot' override the stack. In the scanf we truncate after 15 character to ensure the string is NULL terminated
In the strncpy we ensure the destination buffer is only written to by a max of 16 bytes

I had the idea of breaking when the random code is generated, this would be at generate_code+13, to which eax will hold the final generated code

Honestly I have no idea how we are supposed to grab the pid... I see no vulnerabilities to override the stack and call getpid() ourselves
And I also don't think that is supposed to be the way this is to be solved. There has to be some other logic issue here

After watching the lecture I've realized that there is an uninitialized variable char auth_username[16];
We can 'verify username' even though we haven't set one and get some data back

I can get some random data from that uninitialized variable, but I don't know what it is
I'll have to take a closer look at how the stack is structured during these calls to see what actually happens in memory
